# Provincial Public Administration Employees Per 1000 Residents

This repository contains data, computations and analysis for the number of provincial public administration employees per 1000 residents in different provinces across Canada. The rationale is to find a fair basis for comparing the number of employees in the provincial government in Canada.

## Data Sources
Two data series are used, both from Ststistics Canada:

### Employee Data
1. Statistics Canada refers to the employees included in this data as “Provincial Public Administration Employees” and describes them as follows:
    1. Provincial public administration comprises establishments of provincial or territorial governments primarily engaged in activities of a governmental nature, such as legislative activities, judicial activities, taxation, public order and safety, and the administration of provincial or territorial government programs
    2. Provincial public administration employment includes employees that are actively being paid in the reporting periods (employees paid by the hour, salaried employees and other employees.
    
2. Data Table: [Employee by Industry, Annual ( Table: 14-10-0202-01 (formerly CANSIM 281-0024))](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410020201)

3. Data pulled in October 22, 2023 and so represents the most current data as of the time of this report.
4. The data comes from the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours (SEPH), a comprehensive monthly survey of the labour market
    1. The survey’s target population is composed of businesses in Canada that have at least one employee and, thus issued at least one payroll deduction remittance during the reference month
    2. Data are collected directly from survey respondents, extracted from administrative files and derived from other Statistics Canada surveys and/or other sources.
    3. Information for general government services is provided to SEPH on a monthly basis by the provincial, territorial and federal governments in the form of electronic files extracted from their payroll records.
**5. The annual employee headcount for a calendar year is an average of monthly headcounts in that calendar year**

### Population Data
1. Population data are based on quarterly estimates by Statistics Canada ([Table: 17-10-0009-01 (formerly CANSIM 051-0005) Population Estimates, Quarterly](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000901))
2. Data pulled in October 2023 and so represents the most current numbers
